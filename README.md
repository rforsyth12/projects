# Projects
Repository for my personal software projects.

Rather than having multiple repositories for small projects, all projects
will be contained in this single repository.

Note that the new repository is `rforsyth12.github.io`.

## Useful Code
Create a new branch off master: `git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch> projects/master`

Push current branch onto Github, but not master: `git push projects HEAD`
